## Database  Design
The dataabase was initially created as a relational database, using PostgreSQL. However, after further development, the database was changed to a document-oriented /NoSQL database, MongoDB.

### PostgreSQL
Paw Bytes started off as a DBMS project for a restaurant , however I wanted to take it a step further and make it into a full stack project.

### MongoDB
The transsition from using PostgreSQL to MongoDB was influenced by understanding the most cost-effective way to suppor the project.
